# Tools - Scalable Computing  
Anything that might help with assignments/practical work for scalable computing.  
Any details for the files in here can be found below.  
  
## setup.sh  
Installs dependencies and compiles JohnTheRipper on a fresh ubuntu instance in case any saved images go missing.  
Run this first:  
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guineec/college-tools/master/scalable/setup.sh > setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh
```   
Then run:
```
./setup.sh
```  
... and JtR should be cloned into home and compiled, ready to go.
